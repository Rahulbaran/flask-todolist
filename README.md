# flask-todolist
<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone , This is a to do list app where I have used HTML, CSS(mainly SCSS) for fronte, Flask for backend (Some JavaScript codes are also here to handle events) and SQLite as database.</h3>

<ul><h3>There are following features of the app:-</h3>
  <li> You can create your own account and after registering & logging in you will be able to add new items in the to do list.</li>
  <li>You are also free to customize your account page like uploading a picture ,changing username and email address etc.</li>
</ul>
